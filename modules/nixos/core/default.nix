  # Nice explanation of overlays: https://archive.is/f8goR
  #
  # My summary of the differences between overlays and `overrideAttrs`:
  #
  # Overlays modify the package derivation in nixpkgs whilst `overrideAttrs`
  # only modifies the package in the current context. In practice this means
  # that modifications made with overlays will apply to all instances of the
  # package throughout your entire configuration. If you want to modify a core
  # package that many modules and packages depend on, you can see how this is a
  # powerful feature. However, if not used carefully, overlays can trigger an
  # unwanted system-wide butterfly effect on package dependencies causing many
  # packages to be rebuilt from source. This is because modifying a package in
  # nixpkgs will result in all packages that depend on this package to have
  # their derivation modified and therefore their cache invalidated.
  #
  # `overrideAttrs` avoids this problem because the package is ONLY modified in
  # the context where you applied the override. This means that any dependent
  # packages will continue to use the unmodified version and will continue to
  # use the binary cache. If a module has a `package` option, this can be a
  # convenient place to apply the override as the package will be stored in the
  # option and can be easily reused elsewhere.
  #
  # In my experience, for the majority of packages that I'm overriding, only
  # overriding the package in the current context is sufficient. It has the
  # advantage of being more explicit than overlays and also guarantees no
  # unexpected dependency butterfly effects.
  #
  # Overlays allow for greater modifications to packages than `overrideAttrs`.
  # Literally anything is possible. The entire derivation can be replaced with
  # an entirely different package if desired. However, once again, in the vast
  # majority of cases this extra functionality is not required.
  #
  # To summarise, for the majority of situations where you want to modify a
  # package (using a different src, applying a patch etc...) overlays are NOT
  # necessary and `overrideAttrs` can be used instead. However depending on the
  # situation, overlays might be more convenient or required for their extra
  # functionality.
